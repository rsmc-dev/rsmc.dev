## 📱 Building

[**NourishUs**](/apps/nourishus/)  
Improving performance, expanding personalization, and refining architecture.

Current priorities:
- Refactoring DataStorage class to reduce complexity and improve cycle/phase calculation logic
- Increase Instrumentation to find and improve performance bottlenecks
- Increasing automated UI and unit test coverage

---

## ✍️ Writing

Publishing in-depth technical breakdowns based on real production decisions.

Upcoming posts:
- Managing SwiftUI state in a multi-feature app
- SwiftData in a MVVM architecture
- HealthKit integration with privacy-first design
- Local notifications for app engagement
- Performance profiling with Instruments
- Unit tests before refactor

## 🧠 Studying

- Swift concurrency patterns in production apps
- SwiftUI render behavior and view recalculation
- Unit testing in production apps
- Agentic coding in Xcode

## 🎯 Direction

My goal is to build high-quality, thoughtfully architected iOS applications while documenting the engineering decisions behind them.

I’m intentionally sharpening:
- Architectural clarity
- Performance awareness
- Framework depth
- Long-term maintainability discipline
